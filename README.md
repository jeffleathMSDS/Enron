Some of my Enron work/files

I worked at Enron from the summer of 1999 to bankruptcy on December 3, 2001.

I was initially hired into the Gas Pipeline Group.  McKinsey & Company had been working an engagement with Enron to create a corporate level strategic sourcing unit.  I was hired at this time (with quiet a few others) and we formed the Global Strategic Sourcing unit for Enron Corp.

It was a pretty awesome team that I was fortunate to be apart of.

The database I am attaching is one I built for our teams to track deal flow from initialize to realization.  Looking at it now, the database is really cheesey.  The content is interesting though.  Our group was constantly having to justify our value and this tool helped us tell our story.

*The GSS.mdb is the project database.  GSS stands for Global Strategic Sourcing

* The Airfare excel file was an analysis summary I did on Enron's airfare usage, in preperation for an RFP.

* The "Post 9/11" pdf was something I put together after 9/11 regarding business process changes for personnel accountability.  Enron's travel business practices were managed by our team.

* The "P-Card" excel file was a review I did our Enron's projected ~$130MM annual spend on procurement/travel cards, in prep for an RFP.
* The "Payroll Review" excel file was a summary of an RFP for outsourcing payroll services for our US employees in 2000.  It seemed pretty progressive for the time.

I'm trying to find some of my Y2K 'coming disaster' files...
